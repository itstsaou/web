## Thai Food 😋

### Cook-your-own Route

This is a challenging route you picked. However, nothing will prevent you from having your hand-made Thai food I see.

The closest shop you can stop by and get Thai (or asian) ingredients is the "New Market" on East State Street.
It is across from the Athens Community Center.

If you have a car or a day-off, you can go to Columbus, Ohio which will open up more options. In Columbus, you can
stop by

- [Saraga International Grocery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/idKfsqrbL7CwkXnf9) on Morse Road.
- [Bangkok Grocery & Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6faeSzv9seA2qDxm9) on Refugee Road.

for vast selection of the Thai food ingredients.

### Ready-to-eat Route

If you are a hard working individual like our developers and do not have time to cook your own Thai food, here are
the options we have in Athens, Ohio. This suggestion is not in particular order, but if you are donating
to us, we can move it up or make the font bigger 😉.
